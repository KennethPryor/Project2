# Bootcamp Radio 
### _Powered by Spotify_

## Summary

This Project is a Playlist designed for our class so our Instructors
can't keep playing _Queems_ over and over. You log-in or create an 
account so you can add/vote on songs in the playlist and those songs
will play thanks to Spotify API.

### Future Updates as of 12/10

One of our developers left in the middle of this Project and didn't
start on his task to create the voting system as we planned to be 
released on 12/11. We could not meet the deadline with this feature
so it will be added in a future update.
